    "The amount of mental health issues in young people such as depression, anxiety, and stress are currently at the highest they have ever been. Mental health issues are affecting young people’s performance in their academic, professional, or social lives. As a result of stress, depression, or anxiety, young people are struggling to stay motivated to both work and  This begs the question as to what are the potential underlying cause(s) of the current mental health crises.\n",

    "Does it have to do with whether or not a person is enrolled in university or in the workforce? Based on a Boston University study of their students found that “half of students in fall 2020 screened positive for depression and/or anxiety.” However, is enrollment in University the cause of mental health issues or are people who are not enrolled in university experiencing similar levels of mental health problems. Rather than level of education, are mental health issues caused by the other issues listed in our research question, each of which may have underlying reasons as to why people have mental health issues. \n",

    "According to Recognition and Assessment of Common Mental Disorders in Young People, depression is a common mental disorder in young people and is diagnosable through a specific DSM-IV criteria. However, the article highlights that, “In a young person, hopelessness is recognised as a strong prognostic indication for severe depression and warrants urgent referral.” In our project, we aim to correlate other predictors of depression, such as university enrollment, religion, ethnicity, and household size.\n",

Our reasoning is that the pressure of academic performance, coupled with the stress of transitioning from high school to college / college to workforce potentially leads to higher DASS scores."

    "Our ideal dataset would include unique ambiguous identifiers(serial) that would be associated with subjects so they can remain anonymous and protect their privacy. Associated with each unique identifier would be a completely filled out(no nulls) row of variables consisting of their age(number), enrollment in university(Y/N), ethnicity(pre-filtered in the sense that same religion is accounted for the same religion even if they are spelled incorrectly or capitalized differently; ex. Christian = christian & christianity & christinann etc), size of family(number of siblings), and DASS score(Normal = 0-9, Mild = 10-13, Moderate = 14-20, Severe = 21-27, Extremely severe = 28+). We would want anywhere from 1000-2000 observations. We will not be conducting our own survey so we will not be using social media platforms, word of mouth, or flyers to promote and get individuals to participate. Instead we will be using a trustworthy organization studying depression that would collect this data gathering an unbiased and varied group of participants. The link to this data is https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/depression-anxiety-stress-scales.  This data would ideally be organized into a CSV file with no nulls and unified formatting for each column."

    "There are many possible biases that may occur from the dataset we use. If a certain age group is more inclined to participate in data collection, then the dataset will be biased towards that specific age group. In addition, we must consider that people experiencing depression may not be inclined to willingly participate in data collection without any incentives. The datasets may have collected data from a location with minimal depressed people. Typically, an individual who is depressed may not spend a lot of time outside, which may result in skewed data results. Additionally, how they conduct the data collection process, whether through email, telephone, text, in person, etc.. , only a certain group of people will participate which can correlate to bias. \n",
